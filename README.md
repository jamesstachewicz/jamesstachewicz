# About Me

I am a year 12 student at All Saints' College studying Computer Science ATAR.

###	• validate input before processing (checking that the data inputted is accepted before excecuted)
 
###	• a clear and uncluttered mainline (making sure that the verion of code and type of code you are writing on are the same and controlled variables that must stay the same)

###	• one logical task per subroutine (ensuring that there is one task that is focused on in each subroutine. this is good practice for bug fixing and keeping organised)

###	• use of stubs (used to stubstitue other code and can be useful to keep organised)

###	• appropriate use of control structures and data structures (controlling data where neccessary to keep organised and to ensure you know where to find all data in the case of a bug)

###	• writing for subsequent maintenance (periodicly testing code for bugs as you change and write code. This is to ensure the program is not breaking when the code is run by a user.)

###	• version control (make sure the code you are writing on is on the same version so there is no interferance for bugs and unsupported commands and code.)

###	• regular backup (backing up data is the best way to ensure your data is fine in the event of a hack or crash in your system. backups are very safe and easy to do depending on the size of your data.)

###	• exception handling (responding to unwanted bugs in data.)

###	• functions are able to return a single data structure or value (functions dont have multiple values so that they stay organised and easy to bug fix)
